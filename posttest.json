      "question": "What is the function of a riser in sand casting? (LO2)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To trap impurities in the metal",
        "b": "To increase the mouldâ€™s strength",
        "c": "To supply additional molten metal to compensate for shrinkage",
        "d": "To act as a vent for escaping gases"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A riser stores extra molten metal, ensuring the casting remains free from shrinkage defects.",
        "b": "A riser stores extra molten metal, ensuring the casting remains free from shrinkage defects.",

      "question": "What is the purpose of vents in a sand mould? (LO2)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To allow gases to escape from the mould cavity",
        "b": "To increase the cooling rate of molten metal",
        "c": "To improve the surface finish of the casting",
        "d": "To strengthen the mould"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Vents provide pathways for trapped gases to escape during metal pouring, preventing defects like gas porosity and blowholes, which can weaken the casting.",
        "b": "Vents provide pathways for trapped gases to escape during metal pouring, preventing defects like gas porosity and blowholes, which can weaken the casting.",
        "c": "Vents provide pathways for trapped gases to escape during metal pouring, preventing defects like gas porosity and blowholes, which can weaken the casting.",

      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a gating system in sand casting? (LO2)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To regulate the flow of molten metal into the mould cavity",
        "b": "To cool the metal before it enters the mould",
        "c": "To trap impurities and prevent them from entering the mould",
        "d": "To increase the fluidity of the metal"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The gating system controls the speed and direction of molten metal as it enters the mould, ensuring smooth flow with minimal turbulence to reduce defects like air entrapment and erosion.",
